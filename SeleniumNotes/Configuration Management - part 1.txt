CONFIGURATION FILE

1. APP.CONFIG FILE
	WE WILL USE THIS TO STORE OUR CONFIGURATION 

2. THE CONFIGURATION WILL BE IN THE FORM OF "KEY:VALUE" PAIRS. THE KEYS WILL BE UNIQUE

3. TO LOAD THE CONFIGURATION, WE WILL USE THE SYSTEM.CONFIGURATION SETTING, AN IN-BUILT UTILITY IN VISUAL STUDIO, BY REFERRING TO THE SYSTEM.CONFIGURATION.DLL FILE IN OUR PROJECT

4. THE CLASS WHICH HELPS TO READ THE CONFIGURATION FROM APP.CONFIG IS THE "CONFIGURATION.MANAGER", WHICH CONTAINS AN "APPSETTINGS" PROPERTY

5. THIS APPSETTINGS HAS A GET METHOD, WHICH TAKES A "KEY" AS AN ARGUMENT AND RETURNS ITS "VALUE"

6. ALL CONFIGURATIONS INSIDE THE APP.CONFIG FILE ARE OF TYPE STRING

BASIC FRAMEWORK STRUCTURE

OUR FRAMEWORK WILL HAVE AT THE MINIMUM, THE FOLLOWING FOLDERS:
1. BASECLASSES
2. COMPONENTHELPER
3. CONFIGURATION
4. CUSTOMEXCEPTION
5. EXCELREADER
6. INTERFACES
7. PAGEOBJECT
8. SETTINGS
9. TESTSCRIPT


SETTING UP OUR CONFIGURATION

1. COPY, PASTE AND RENAME THE EXISTING PACKAGE.CONFIG FILE TO APP.CONFIG
2. 	ADD THE CONFIGURATION & APPSETTINGS TAGS, THEN THE KEY:VALUE PAIRS
	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<configuration>
  <appSettings>
    <add key="Browser" value="firefox"/>
    <add key="Username" value="User"/>
    <add key="Password" value="Pass"/>
  </appSettings>
</configuration>
3. THEN, REFERENCE THE SYSTEM.CONFIGURATION IN THE PROJECT 	  
	ConfigurationManager.AppSettings.Get("Browser");
    ConfigurationManager.AppSettings.Get("Username");
    ConfigurationManager.AppSettings.Get("Password");
	
ICONFIG INTERFACE
1. THIS INTERFACE WILL CONTAIN SOME BASIC METHODS REQUIRED FOR THE FRAMEWORK SUCH AS "GETBROWSER"

2. ALL CLASSES THAT WILL READ DATA FROM AN EXTERNAL FILE SYSTEM, WILL HAVE TO IMPLEMENT THIS INTERFACE

3. THE REASON FOR ENFORCING THIS RESTRICTION IS THAT THERE ARE BASIC IMPORTANT METHODS THAT THE FRAMEWORK NEEDS TO INITIALIZE

4. CREATE AN ICONFIG INTERFACE IN THE INTERFACE FOLDER
	public interface IConfig
    {
        //let's create the basic methods important for this class
		BROWSERTYPE GETBROWSER();
        STRING GETUSERNAME();
		STRING GETPASSWORD();
    }

5. CREATE AN ENUM FOR THE BROWSERS IN THE BROWSERTYPE CLASS IN THE CONFIGURATION FOLDER. 
	 public enum BrowserType
    {
        Firefox,
        Chrome,
        IExplorer
    }

6. CREATE AN APPCONFIGREADER CLASS IN THE CONFIGURATION FOLDER, WHICH WILL READ THE DATA FROM THE APPSETTINGS
	PUBLIC CLASS APPCONFIGREADER : ICONFIG
	{
		
	}
	
7. IN THE SETTINGS FOLDER, ADD A CLASS TO READ THE KEYS FROM THE APP.CONFIG FILE
	PUBLIC CLASS APPCONFIGKEYS
	{
		PUBLIC CONST STRING BROWSER = "BROWSER";
		PUBLIC CONST STRING USERNAME = "USERNAME";
		PUBLIC CONST STRING PASSWORD = "PASSWORD";
	}
