BEHAVIOUR DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT TESTING(BDD)

	1. BDD TESTING IS AN ENHANCEMENT OF TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT (TDD)
	2. IN BDD, WE ALSO WRITE TESTS FIRST, THEN ADD THE CODE FOR THE TEST 
	3. TESTS ARE WRITTEN IN PLAIN ENGLISH-TYPE GRAMMAR
	4. EVERY TESTS REPRESENTS A BEHAVIOUR OF THE APPLICATION

WHAT IS CUCUMBER?

	1. CUCUMBER IS A TESTING FRAMEWORK THAT SUPPORTS BDD 
	2. IT LETS US DEFINE APPLICATION BEHAVIOUR IN PLAIN ENGLISH TEXT
	3. IT USES GRAMMAR DEFINED BY A LANGUAGE CALLED GHERKIN
	4. GHERKIN LANGUAGE PROVIDES THE KEYWORDS SUCH AS GIVEN, WHEN, THEN, AND, BUT
	5. COMBINING ALL ENABLES US TO WRITE EFFECTIVE TEST SCENARIOS
	
WHAT IS SPECFLOW?

	1. IT IS THE .NET IMPLEMENTATION OF CUCUMBER
	2. IT IS AVAILABLE IN THE FORM OF A PACKAGE, WHICH CAN BE INSTALLED IN THE PROJECT WITH THE HELP OF THE 'NUGET' PACKAGE MANAGER
	3. STEPS TO ACCOMPLISH THIS:
		a. NAVIGATE TO 'TOOLS' TAB IN THE VISUAL STUDIO IDE
		b. SELECT 'EXTENSIONS AND UPDATES'
		c. SELECT 'ONLINE' SUB-MENU
		d. SEARCH FOR SPECFLOW
		e. THEN INSTALL THE DISPLAYED SPECFLOW EXTENSION
		f. RIGHT-CLICK ON THE PROJECT AND SELECT THE 'MANAGE NUGET PACKAGES..." OPTION
		g. SEARCH FOR SPECFLOW AGAIN
		h. INSTALL THE DISPLAYED SPECFLOW EXTENSION, WHICH WILL ADD AN ADDITIONAL ENTRY IN THE APP.CONFIG FILE 
		i. OPEN THE APP.CONFIG FILE AND ADD THE FOLLOWING ENTRY, TO FORCE SPECFLOW TO USE MSTEST FRAMEWORK WHEN RUNNING THE TESTS 
			<unitTestProvider name="MsTest" />
		MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS ADDED AFTER THE FIRST SPECFLOW TAG IN THE APP.CONFIG FILE 
		j. IN ORDER TO CHECK THAT THE PROCESS IS SUCCESSFUL, RIGHT-CLICK ON THE PROJECT, SELECT ADD AND THE FOLLOWING SPECFLOW OPTIONS SHOULD BE DISPLAYED:
			i. SPECFLOW FEATURE FILE 
			ii. SPECFLOW HOOKS (EVENT BINDING)
			iii. SPECFLOW STEP DEFINITION
			
GHERKIN LANGUAGE

1. THIS IS PRIMARILY USED TO STRUCTURE OUR TESTS 
2. WE USE CERTAIN GHERKIN KEYWORDS TO WRITE THE TEST IN FEATURE FILE 
3. CUCUMBER UNDERSTANDS THE GHERKIN LANGUAGE. IT PARSES THE FILE, USING THE GRAMMAR PROVIDED BY THE GHERKIN LANGUAGE
4. AS SUCH, IT IS CALLED THE CUCUMBER TEST 

IN SPECFLOW, THERE ARE TWO IMPORTANT FILES

1. FEATURE FILE: WHICH WILL HOUSE THE TEST SCENARIO
2. STEP DEFINITION: WHICH WILL HAVE THE CODE FOR EACH STEP OF THE FEATURE FILE

GHERKIN KEYWORDS

1. FEATURE: EACH FEATURE FILE BEGINS WITH THIS KEYWORD. IT PROVIDES THE NAME AND DESCRIPTION OF THE FEATURE WHICH IS UNDER TEST 
2. SCENARIO: EACH FEATURE CAN HAVE MORE THAN ONE TEST. A TEST IS DESCRIBED BY THE SCENARIO KEYWORD
3. GIVEN: THIS KEYWORD DEFINES THE PRECONDITIONS OF A SCENARIO
4. AND: THIS KEYWORD IS USED TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL CONDITION TO A STEP. IT CAN BE USED WITH 'GIVEN', 'WHEN', 'THEN', 'BUT'
5. WHEN: THIS DEFINES AN ACTION THAT WILL BE EXECUTED
6. THEN: THIS DEFINES THE OUTCOME OF A PREVIOUS STEP 
7. BUT: THIS DEFINES A NEGATIVE CONDITION ADDED TO A PREVIOUS STEP 
8. BACKGROUND: THIS DEFINES A NUMBER OF STEPS COMMON ACROSS A NUMBER OF SCENARIOS
