CHROME & INTERNETEXPLORER OPTIONS

THE CHROMEOPTIONS(); CLASS -- THIS IS USED TO LAUNCH THE CHROME BROWSER WITH ADDITIONAL SETTINGS

IT CONTAINS SUCH METHODS LIKE
	1. ADDARGUMENT -- USED TO SUPPLY THE COMMAND LINE ARGUMENT DURING THE LAUNCHING OF THE BROWSER
	2. ADDEXTENSION -- IS USED TO ADD THE EXTENSION INSIDE THE BROWSER

THESE METHODS WILL LAUNCH THE CHROME BROWSER WITH ADDITIONAL COMMAND LINE PARAMETERS AND CHROME EXTENSIONS SUCH AS POSTMAN

SO IN THE BASECLASS, LET'S CREATE A STATIC METHOD FOR THE CHROMEOPTIONS. WE CAN THEN CALL THE CHROMEOPTIONS OBJECT.

	PRIVATE STATIC CHROMEOPTIONS GETCHROMEOPTIONS() {
		CHROMEOPTIONS COPTION = NEW CHROMEOPTIONS();
		/**
		*IF WE DRILL DOWN INTO THE CHROMEOPTIONS CLASS, THE MULTITUDE 
		*OF OPTIONS AND PROPERTIES AVAILABLE TO US FOR USE
		*BECOMES MUCH CLEARER
		*FOR EXAMPLE, WE CAN MAXIMIZE THE BROWSER INSTANCE
		*/
		COPTION.ADDARGUMENT("START-MAXIMIZED");
		RETURN COPTION
	}

NOW THAT WE HAVE THIS PARTICULAR OPTION, WE CAN THEN CALL IT AS A PARAMETER IN THE DRIVER INSTANCE OF OUR CHROME BROWSER LAUNCH
	PRIVATE STATIC IWEBDRIVER GETCHROMEDRIVER(){
		IWEBDRIVER DRIVER = NEW CHROMEDRIVER(GETCHROMEOPTIONS);
		RETURN DRIVER;
	}

IF WE NOW RUN THE TEST, CHROME SHOULD BE LAUNCHED IN MAXIMIZED MODE. 

INTERNETEXPLOREROPTIONS(); CLASS -- THIS IS USED TO LAUNCH THE IE BROWSER WITH ADDITIONAL SETTINGS.

IN THIS CLASS, WE HAVE PROPERTIES SUCH AS "INTRODUCEINSTABILITYBYIGNORINGPROTECTEDMODESETTINGS". THIS WILL DISABLE THE PROTECTION MODE OF IE AT LAUNCH TIME

SO IN THE BASECLASS, LET'S CREATE A STATIC METHOD FOR THE INTERNETEXPLOREROPTIONS. WE CAN THEN CALL THE INTERNETEXPLOREROPTIONS OBJECT.

	PRIVATE STATIC INTERNETEXPLOREROPTIONS GETIEOPTIONS() {
		INTERNETEXPLOREROPTIONS IEOPTION = NEW INTERNETEXPLOREROPTIONS();
		/**
		*IF WE DRILL DOWN INTO THE INTERNETEXPLOREROPTIONS CLASS, THE MULTITUDE 
		*OF OPTIONS AND PROPERTIES AVAILABLE TO US FOR USE
		*BECOMES MUCH CLEARER
		*/
		IEOPTION.INTRODUCEINSTABILITYBYIGNORINGPROTECTEDMODESETTINGS = TRUE;
		IEOPTION.ENSURECLEANSESSION = TRUE; //THIS WILL CLEAR ALL COOKIES BEFORE STARTING THE BROWSER
		RETURN IEOPTION
	}

NOW THAT WE HAVE THIS PARTICULAR OPTION, WE CAN THEN CALL IT AS A PARAMETER IN THE DRIVER INSTANCE OF OUR INTERNETEXPLORER BROWSER LAUNCH
	PRIVATE STATIC IWEBDRIVER GETIEDRIVER(){
		IWEBDRIVER DRIVER = NEW INTERNETEXPLORERDRIVER(GETIEOPTIONS());
		RETURN DRIVER;
	}
	
FIREFOX PROFILE CLASS

FIREFOXPROFILE(); CLASS -- THIS IS USED TO LAUNCH FIREFOX WITH A USER PROFILE. THIS IS BASICALLY THE SETTINGS SET BY THE USER FOR FIREFOX, AS OPPOSED TO THE DEFAULT SETTINGS. IE, BOOKMARKS, ENABLED ADD-ONS, ETC

FIREFOXPROFILEMANAGER(); CLASS -- IS USED TO GET THE USER PROFILE FOR THE FIREFOX BROWSER

TO SEE YOUR CURRENT FIREFOX PROFILE, USE THE FOLLOWING STEPS:
	1. CLOSE ANY OPEN INSTANCE OF FIREFOX
	2. CLICK THE WINDOWS START BUTTON, THEN TYPE 'RUN'
	3. IN THE DISPLAYED DIALOG BOX, ENTER 'FIREFOX.EXE -P"
	4. EITHER CLICK THE 'OK' BUTTON OR SELECT THE 'ENTER' KEY ON YOUR KEYBOARD
	5. YOUR FIREFOX PROFILE MANAGER WINDOW SHOULD BE DISPLAYED
	
SO, LET'S CREATE THE FIREFOXPROFILE CLASS IN THE BASECLASS

	PRIVATE STATIC FIREFOXPROFILE GETFIREFOXOPTIONS(){
		FIREFOXPROFILE FPROFILE = NEW FIREFOXPROFILE();
		FIREFOXPROFILEMANAGER FXMANAGER = NEW FIREFOXPROFILEMANAGER();
		FPROFILE = FXMANAGER.GETPROFILE("DEFAULT");
		RETURN FPROFILE;
	}

NOW THAT WE HAVE THIS PARTICULAR OPTION, WE CAN THEN CALL IT AS A PARAMETER IN THE DRIVER INSTANCE OF OUR FIREFOX BROWSER LAUNCH
	PRIVATE STATIC IWEBDRIVER GETFIREFOXDRIVER(){
		IWEBDRIVER DRIVER = NEW FIREFOXDRIVER(GETFIREFOXOPTIONS());
		RETURN DRIVER;
	}    

WHEN WE NOW LAUNCH, THIS INSTANCE OF THE FIREFOX BROWSER WILL DISPLAY ALL THE BOOKMARKS, ETC LINKED TO OUR DEFAULT PROFILE ON THE MACHINE

SUPPOSE WE WANT TO GET THE TITLE OF THE CURRENT PAGE. INSIDE IWEBDRIVER, THERE IS A PROPERTY CALLED 'TITLE' THAT CAN DO THIS FOR US.

IN THE TEST METHOD, ENTER THE FOLLOWING:
	CONSOLE.WRITELINE(OBJECTREPOSITORY.DRIVER.TITLE);
	
WE CAN SMARTEN UP OUR CODE BY CREATING A HELPER METHOD IN THE COMPONENTHELPER FOLDER TO TAKE CARE OF THIS FOR US 
	PUBLIC CLASS WINDOWHELPER{
		PUBLIC STATIC STRING GETTITLE(){
			RETURN 	OBJECTREPOSITORY.DRIVER.TITLE;
		}
	}
	
SO THE CODE THAT WE ENTERED INTO THE TEST METHOD TO GET THE PAGE TITLE NOW BECOMES:
	CONSOLE.WRITELINE(WINDOWHELPER.GETTITLE() );
